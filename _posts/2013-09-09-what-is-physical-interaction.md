After reading the first two chapters of "The Art of Interactive Design", by Chris Crawford's and "A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design" by Bret Victor, I define physical interaction is an engaging conversation which is established through the iterative process of listening, thinking and speaking ( the order is important ). And the future of interactivity lies in exploring the full capabilities of the user than just limiting to a known few. 

Good physical interaction can be acheived if,


- The routine of listening, thinking and speaking ( in order ) forms the core of the interaction
- The form ( speaking through the interface ) follows the function ( thinking )
- The user's capabilities are explored to the fullest while thoroughly engaging him

An example of a digital technology that is not interactive is "Traffic Lights". Though each one of us has been using it for decades, on a day to day basis, not much of an  improvement has been done since its inception. Speaking of its interactivity, it fails in the aspects of listening and thinking. It is completely unaware of people who jump the signal or a pedestrian who just stumbled while crossing the road. It just speaks its algorithmic instructions ( AI based models ) in colors ( sometimes in sound ) and assumes the user to follow certain rules. Also it cannot differentiate between novice / expert drivers and between people who are native / new to the city.
I see a tremendous scope in making traffic lights interactive if only more people start thinking in the direction of "interactivity".

###Miscellaneous Thoughts:

[Question] If an object contains a computing device at its core, has a means of taking input and giving the output, does it qualify to be called Interactive?
