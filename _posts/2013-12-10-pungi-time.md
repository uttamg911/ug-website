**Concept:** The installation is a two player game that is played by blowing a flute and rolling a sphere. The person blowing the flute takes the role of snake charmer and controls a snake and the other person controls the egg by rolling a sphere. The challenge is for the egg to cross the screen from one end to the other without getting eaten by the snake. If the egg is successfully able to cross the screen, it gets 10 points else and if the snake manages to eat the egg it gets 10 points. The environment also contains obstacles which give a chance for the egg to hide momentarily. The game tends to get more exciting as two people compete against each other to achieve their respective goals in a limited time of 60 seconds. When both the players decide to end the game, the player with the highest points wins the game.

**Interactions** The primary interactions in the game are blowing into the flute and pressing buttons and rolling a sphere. 

**Technologies Involved**
The flute and the sphere communicate with the processing sketch through an XBee Radio communication. The piezo, the switches and the gyroscopes within the flute communicate with the arduino which records the data and sends to the processing sketch via XBee radio communication. Similarly the gyro into the sphere also communicates with the sketch through XBee radio communication as well.
