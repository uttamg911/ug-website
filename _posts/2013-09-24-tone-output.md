This is a lab to demonstrates tone generation using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). 

**Challenges & Learnings:**

* The 8-bit speaker which comes with the Arduino Starter Kit doesn't produce loud sounds hence a resistor in series with the speaker need not be used.
* Adding two LDRs acts as a voltage divder.
