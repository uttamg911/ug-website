This video is an iconic example of George Carlin’s humor filled epiphanies. He says things like “The earth is fine. Its the people who are @##@$ up!”, Plastic creation might be the answer to the age old philosophical question of “Why are we here?” and HIV might be a mechanism for the earth to shake a threat ( like us ) off like a bad case of fleas.

Speaking of George Carlin, he is not like other stand-up comedians who seem their whole purpose is to just toss in a couple of cuss words / impersonate someone / be racist. His works are often identified by funny yet novel interpretations of our conventional thoughts which first crack us up but eventually make us think. With his unique narrative style, he has taken the artform of stand-up comedy beyond poetry, creative writing and performance. I find it safe to call his works as performances because I assume even he considers it the same. This is reflected in his voice modulations, his antics, his personality and even the pose in which he ends his sketches ( a single leg bow ).

Needless to say, I am great fan of his and I wish to express my admiration by taking a similar analogy ( like the one in this video )  on why the mankind needed him. With his remarkable knowledge on a wide range of topics,  wittiness and profound oratory skills he could have been a historian or a science teacher or a professor but he chose to be a comedian. Because this is the most fun and engaging way to be all of the above, at the same time, which can give the joy of wisdom to his pupils ( the audience ).
