Today is the first day of Physical Computing Class at ITP. I exchanged ideas with some super awesome creativite people. The class was unlike any other classes that I had attended in the past. A lot of questions were asked like, What is a micro-controller and how is it different from a computer? What is the difference betwen Analog and Digital? What is your favorite tool? It was totally amazing to share ideas, learn different opinions, and understand others' view points. I also learned that the aim of this course would be to create physical interfaces that would engage the users and make them use again and again. 

Here is a list of favorite tools of my friends

<ul style="font-family: Lato ">
	<li>Tom Igoe - Altman Wrench ( likes its design and utility )</li>
	<li>TK - Swiss Army Knife ( likes the UX )</li>

	<li>Yoon - Scissors ( likes the way it cuts paper )</li>
	<li>Batu - 8x8 Midi Interface ( likes because it gives the mental model of XY parameters in space )</li>
	<li>Jacob - Drafting Tools ( likes the way they function and move across the drafting paper )</li>
	<li>Joey - Analog Caliper ( likes because it helps understand physical objects in measurement )</li>
	<li>Abe - Allen Keys & Hex Wrenches ( likes its design and utility )</li>
	<li>Kelly - Sharpie Pens ( likes the UX and soft feel it gives when you write )</li>
	<li>Uttam - Sand Paper / Abrasive tools ( like its flexibility to remove material as well as give a good finish )</li>
