This is a lab to demonstrates analog output. In this case, interacting with a servo using a range finder ( ultrasonic sensor )

**Challenges & Learnings:**

* The range finder which we used seemed inappropriate for the use of controlling a servo. The signal was not consistent and had lot of noise which made the servo twitch
