This is a lab to demonstrate analog input to an Arduino using a potentiometer. 

**Challenges & Learnings:**

* The potentiometer doesn't fit into the solderless breadboard. Hence, proper care should be taken to avoid any loose connections.
* It would have been better if a tripod was used to record the videos.
