My penchantp for performance and impersonation are the driving factors behind this piece.

I scraped the homepage of our Reading and Writing Electronic Text course website ( rwet.decontextualize.com )
and got the lines which contain the word "Python". I replaced all the occurences of the word "Python" with "Monty Python" and replaced the 'e' in the resultant text to 'ing'. The outcome did really turn out funny. Shall soon upload an audio file of my performance.
