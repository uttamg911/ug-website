This python code snippet inverts the words in a line.

import sys #imports system files

<script src="https://gist.github.com/uttamg911/9124985.js"></script>

for line in sys.stdin:
	line = line.strip() # Tabs tell python that it is part of the loop
	word = line.split(' ')
	s = ''
	for i in range(1,len(word)+1):
		s = s + word[len(word)-i] + ' '
	print s

A better way to write the above code.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/uttamg911/9317783.js"></script>

import sys #imports system files

for line in sys.stdin:
        line = line.strip() # Strips a string of its trailing white spaces # Tabs tell python that it is part of the loop
        word = line.split(' ') # Makes a list of substrings by using space as as delimiter
        s = ' '.join(word[::-1]) # [::-1] reverses the contents of a list # The syntax for join is counter intuitive, first you write the delimiter and then the list.
        print s # Prints the string

This unix script translates the letters of a word to numbers ( a-z or A-Z to 1-26 )

Example:

When the above code snippet and unix 'sort', 'tr 'a-z' '.' are operated in tandem,

The poem,

<span style="color:#CCC">

<i>Rose, harsh rose,<br/>
marred and with stint of petals,<br/>
meagre flower, thin,<br/>
spare of leaf,<br/>

more precious<br/>
than a wet rose<br/>
single on a stem -- <br/>
you are caught in the drift.<br/>

Stunted, with small leaf,<br/>
you are flung on the sand,<br/>
you are lifted<br/>
in the crisp sand<br/>
that drives in the wind.<br/>

Can the spice-rose<br/>
drip such acrid fragrance<br/>
hardened in a leaf?</i>

</span>

gets transformed to
