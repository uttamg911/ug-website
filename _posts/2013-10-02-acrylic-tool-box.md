I was storing my electronic components in plastic bags and plastic cups. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rios.rios.7" target="blank">David Rios</a> ( my senior at ITP ) saw this and told me to invest in a box. So I did invest in making one :) The divisions of the tool box are made with 1/4" foam-core board. The tool-box has a hinge loaded lid ( Glued thin acrylic sheet to make the hinge )

**Tools & Materials Used**

* Plastic Scoring Tool
* Straight Edge
* Acrylic Solvent Cement ( Methylene Chloride )
* 18"x24" 1/8" clear cast acrylic from <a href="http://canalplastic.com/" target="blank">Canal Plastic Center</a>

**Step 1:** I marked the dimensions on the acryclic sheet, scored the borders and split it into two ( Top half ). Also removed a thin strip of the paper to apply the solvent cement.

**Step 2:** Then repeated the same process for the other half of the sheet. ( Bottom half )

**Step 3:** Again repeated the same process for the four sides.

**Step 4:** Applied the solvent cement ( Methylene Chloride ) using an applicator bottle and TADA! the acrylic tool box is ready! The cement is set so quickly ( in less than a minute ) that I had to rush and quickly attach all the walls. So couldn't actually document the in between steps. Now, I cut the foam core board to make the divisions for the box and arranged all my electronic components.

The toolbox also nicely fits in my locker :)

**Challenges & Learnings**

* The solvent cement runs a lot so the edges should be kept vertical while applying it
* Also keeping the paper intact would keep the acrylic sheet's gloss intact while working with it
