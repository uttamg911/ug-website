	<p>The element which forms the core of Mumbai's Services, Resources and People is the city in itself. This thought is portrayed as a functioning biological heart. Further, the typeface of the word Mumbai reflects the philosophy of <em>Mumbai Meri Jaan</em>.</p>

	<p>The interdependence is visualized as how the city of Mumbai transforms Ideas into Art, Planned Sanitation into Metropolis, Transportation into Environmental Sustainability and finally Loads of Love into Peace, Education & Healthcare . The graphic contains these ideas as 4 sets of inputs and their corresponding outputs.</p>

	<ul style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif">
		<li>Paper Planes ( Ideas ) ----> Film , Green sheets ( Art )</li>
		<li>Pipes ( Planned Sanitation ) ----> Buildings ( Metropolis )</li>
		<li>Cars ( Transportation ) ----> Green Leaves ( Environment sustainability )</li>
		<li>Hearts ( Loads of Love ) ----> Pigeons, Alphabets, Crosses ( Peace , Education  Healthcare )</li> 
	</ul>
