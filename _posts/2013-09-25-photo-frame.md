Happy to anounce a new addition in my room, a photo frame that I made with salvaged wooden packing.
<br/>At last, the lonely easel board found a companion :)

**Tools & Materials Used**

* Bosch Chop-saw
* Elmer's wood glue
* IRWIN's Quick-Grip 36" clamps
* 3M's 150 grit sand paper
* Salvaged wood from electronics packing

**Step 1:** I carefully removed the nails of the packing, stacked the wooden bars and fastened them with cloth duct tape. Then loaded the stack onto a chop saw ( which is set to 45 degrees ). *Attention:* Sawing a stack of wood bars is not appropriate for three reasons. First, Laziness is not good especially if you are a maker! ( I learned the hard way :( ). Second, if the chop-saw is not accurate, all the wooden bars would require re-working. Next, and the most important is never overload the chop-saw. The feed rate should be slow ( giving pauses when cutting thick material would help in cooling the saw ). **If you smell burnt wood while sawing, stop the machine immediately! It might result in a fire hazard.**

This is the piece which came out after step 1.

**Step 2:** Now I positioned the stack to the marked length ( smaller dimension of the rectangle ) and tried to carefully chop through the first two wooden bars ( This was a bad idea as I din't know when to stop which resulted in a slight cut on the third bar. I eventually pushed it to the backside of the frame. )

**Step 3:** I repositioned the stack to the marked length ( larger dimension of the rectangle ) and chopped through out the stack.

**Step 4:** I applied Elmer's wood glue to the corners, clamped the bars and tried to fix the damaged caused by step 2.

**Step 5:** As speculated, the chop saw was not totally accurate so had to put a thin cardboard piece in the gap formed at one of the corners.

**Step 6:** After keeping it clamped for 12-24 hours, the wooden photo frame was ready. I gave a quick run with 300 grit sand paper for a smooth finish.

**Challenges & Learnings:**

* Never stack and chop saw multiple wooden bars. Don't be lazy. It might result in a fire hazard if the chop saw is overloaded.
* Maintaining 90 degree angularity is kind of difficult if not planned properly. This photo frame has 89 degree angles on two sides which is the result of inaccuracies in the chop saw. Using a <a href="http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base_images/ms/safe_control_of_small_miter_saw_off_cuts.jpg" target="blank">carpenter's miter</a> to saw the angles is a better approach.
